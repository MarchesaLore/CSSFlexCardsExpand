# NO LAYOUT SHIFT ON CARD OPENING

Fix Height for my cards in a grid layout
So when opening the description there is no shift in the layout


I created a codepen to view the sample and play with it

and on click the card will expand on top of the others without causeing a shift on the layout of the grid

also just for fun I am creating the cards with a for statement
and I alligned the image in center using flex
